There are two sets of tables included here - the long table and the
short table.  Most of the time, all you will need is the short table.

The short table is an 80-byte Fixed Blocked member of this pds, which
contains the minimum URL to access each video on YouTube, plus the name
of each person interviewd.  The long table contains a longer URL on
YouTube, which when used, also displays the entire collection of these
interviews.  You will not need to look at the long table often.

Since this pds is a card image file, FB, LRECL=80, I have XMIT-ed the
member which is a wider file, Fixed Blocked and Record Length = 132.
You can access it by RECEIVE-ing it:  Example:

        RECEIVE INDS(this.pds(OMPURLS))

Or you can use the newest versions of the REVIEW command (51.3 or later)
to view the XMIT-ted member.  Just REVIEW the member, and REVIEW (at
that level) will un-XMIT it into a copy on your TSO tube.

**   THE TABLE INCLUDED HERE IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECTLY FINDING  **
**   A VIDEO THAT YOU WANT TO SEE.  YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT   **
**   DIRECTLY USING OUR TABLE, ADDRESSING THE URL SPECIFICALLY.      **

**   I NEVER TRUST A WEB PAGE TO STAY THERE FOREVER.  SOMETIMES A    **
**   DIRECT URL WILL PERSIST LONGER THAN THE PAGE POINTING TO IT.    **

The following table, member PODURLS in this pds, is meant to help
you watch any of the "I Am A Mainframer" videos that you want to see.

The following is a link to the podcast list for the
"I Am A Mainframer" series of podcasts on YouTube.
Just copy this URL into your browser for a complete list of
interviews.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8REpLGaY9QHNU5g4GIzdz4CA64l24FOR


Quick Instructions for viewing a podcast:

Method 1.

Edit or Browse the member PODURLS, pick which video you want
to see, use your terminal emulator to copy the URL (the https://
stuff, which is printable EBCDIC) and paste the URL into your
browser, and go.  Since the URL is printable, your cut and paste
mechanism in the terminal emulator should itself make the ASCII
translation.

Method 2.

Download the member PODURLS to the PC, WITH ASCII TRANSLATION.

Browse the ASCII member with your browser.

Select the video you want to see.

Copy the URL for that video which is on the same line as the
name of the person being interviewed.

Paste the URL into your browser, and go.

We hope to update these tables, as the Linux Foundation makes more
videos.
